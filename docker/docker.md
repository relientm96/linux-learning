## What is a container?

- A way to package an application with all necessary dependencies and configuration.
- That package is a portable artifact, easily shared and moved around.

## Why containers?

### Application development **without** containers

-  An application requires an environment to run on.
-  An environment may contain many different depedencies for the application to run (such as node.js, postgres, sql, etc...)
-  To share application among developers, they would also need to have installed the same dependencies to run on the same environment.
- This is very troublesome as 
  - Installation process highly variable, especially if  on different operating systems.
  - Many manual steps to install, and something could go wrong along the way.

How do containers solve this problem?
